            The police believe you and leave, and the alien thanks you for protecting them. 
            Their species arrives and transports the ship and the alien back up to their mother ship. 
            A week later there is a broadcast that announces that the human race has signed a 
            treaty with an alien species and the aliens want to colbrate with humans and help each other progress. 
            All thanks to you and your help when one of them was in need.
