            Seeing the police coming over the alien runs back to their ship quickly and the police sees this and calls for backup. 
            The military arrives and at the same time the alien species transports the ship back up to their big ship. 
            The military interrogates you and never gives you any reward money. 
            A few days later there is a broadcast across the world with The alien species declaring war on the human race because of you.
